### Importing Code from GitHub into SolPG

You can import code from GitHub into SolPG by clicking the little GitHub icon in the top left-hand corner.   
   
> Sometimes you may need to create a new project to see this icon.   
   
Once you click the icon, SolPG will give you instructions on how to import different types of programs into SolPG.   
   
The key is to make sure you're importing the url that points to the root directory of your Rust code.
