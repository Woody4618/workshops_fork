# Workshop Format

We can choose to experiment with various forms of workshops, such as:

- Q&A format with low to no coding
- Step-by-step workshops where different branches show different stages of the build
    - ie. branches: `step-1`, `step-2`, `step-3`, `final`
- Interactive dApps hosted on Vercel that participants can play with

Feel free to brainstorm new workshops, try things out, and jam on ideas within this page.
