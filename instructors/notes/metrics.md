# ðŸ“Š Metrics

We want to collect feedback & track retention/engagement after weâ€™ve conducted these workshops.

Letâ€™s keep this simple for now:
* If we have everyone fork the stripped repo, we can track forks during the workshop & look at commits on those forks
* If we have participants submit homework features, we can have our submission app track how many wallets & program IDs submitted new Program IDs.
* If we send out a simple form at the end of the event - HH, hackathon, etc. - to collect anyoneâ€™s feedback I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s much of an ask either.
