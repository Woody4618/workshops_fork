# ðŸŽ¥ Recording Workshops

When recording workshops, we want to keep in mind the following requirements:
* Have a good camera for your headshot
* Have a good microphone for clear, clean audio
* Record using a platform such as OBS where you can feature your screen as the main capture, with a headshot recording in one of the corners of the screen

You can choose how to record your workshops. Ideally, all live sessions where workshops are conducted should be recorded, but you can optionally also record a scripted version without an audience.
