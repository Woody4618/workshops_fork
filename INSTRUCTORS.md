# Workshop Instructors

Notes on conducting workshops can be found within each workshop in the `CONDUCTING.md` file.   
   
### Sharing Results & Feedback

Please share any results, feedback, or ideas in the [`instructors/` folder](./instructors/).   
   
We want to collaborate on the following concepts:
* Which workshops had the most impact
* The best format for conducting workshops
* The best format for recording workshops
* How we can track metrics on workshop engagement, post-workshop engagement, etc.
* How we can determine new workshop ideas
* and more
